This Program modifies some basic Windows 10 Settings.
It has only been tested with Windows 10 Pro, not Home or Enterprise.

Use this program at your own risk!
I assume no liability for damages or loss of data.

!!!IMPORTANT!!!
Before executing:
Copy PSWindowsUpdate to C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
(Manually or run copyPSWindowsUpdate.cmd)

You need to run the program as Administrator (Right click -> Run as Administrator).

Sometimes some Settings are not set correctly, so you still need to Check them!
